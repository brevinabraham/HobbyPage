                <p>
                    Trading refers to the buying and selling of financial instruments, 
                    such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies, with the aim of generating profits from short-term price movements. 
                    <br>
                    It can be an exciting and potentially lucrative activity, but it also carries risks, 
                    so it's important to approach it with knowledge and caution.

                        <br>
                        <strong>Don't rush into large trades without proper analysis and risk assessment.</strong></li>
